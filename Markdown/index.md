I **will** complete these lessons!

## I read this interesting quote the other day:

> "Her eyes had called him and his soul had leaped at the call. To live, to err, to fall, to triumph, to recreate life out of life!"





>Once upon a time and a very good time it was there was a moocow coming down along the road and this moocow that was coming down along the road met a nicens little boy named baby tuckoo...

His father told him that story: his father looked at him through a glass: he had a hairy face.

>He was baby tuckoo. The moocow came down the road where Betty Byrne lived: she sold lemon platt.



> His words seemed to have struck some deep chord in his own nature. Had he spoken
of himself, of himself as he was or wished to be? Stephen watched his face for some
moments in silence. A cold sadness was there. He had spoken of himself, of his own
loneliness which he feared.

> —Of whom are you speaking? Stephen asked at length.
>
> Cranly did not answer.


## In the box below, turn the words separated by a comma into a list

* Apples
* Bananas
* Bread
* Milk
* slamon
* Eggs 
* Meats
* Vegetables 


# _Each dot ( · ) represents a space on the keyboard._

Let's try this technique out. In the box below, insert the necessary number of spaces to make the poem render correctly:
We pictured the meek mild creatures where  
They dwelt in their strawy pen,  
Nor did it occur to one of us there  
To doubt they were kneeling then.  

# with line breaks:

Do I contradict myself?<br>
Very well then I contradict myself,<br>
(I am large, I contain multitudes.)


## To format the list with soft breaks in Markdown (tightening the sub-paragraphs without using hard breaks), you'd write it like this:

1. __Crack three eggs over a bowl.  
   Now, you're going to want to crack the eggs in such a way that you don't make a mess.__  
   _If you _do_ make a mess, use a towel to clean it up!_

2. __Pour a gallon of milk into the bowl.__  
   _Basically, take the same guidance as above: don't be messy, but if you are, clean it up!_



1. Crack three eggs over a bowl.  
   Now, you're going to want to crack the eggs in such a way that you don't make a mess.  
   If you _do_ make a mess, use a towel to clean it up!

2. Pour a gallon of milk into the bowl.  
   Basically, take the same guidance as above: don't be messy, but if you are, clean it up!



## Congratulations!

> we’ve only just begun exploring what can be accomplished with Markdown. There are many “extended” implementations of Markdown that support formats like tables, definition lists, footnotes, and more. Because they’re non-standard, they’re not essential to learning the basics, as we’ve introduced here.

>  If you’d like to know more about these Markdown implementations, you’re welcome to explore any number of other Markdown apps and tutorials. Here are just a few:
